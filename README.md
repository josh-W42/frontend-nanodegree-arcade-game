# Udacity FrontEnd Nanodegree Project: Classic Arcade Game Clone

## Description.
	This a clone of the classic game 'froger'. This goal of this game is to cross an enemy filled street to reach the water. However, players can lose lives if they come in contact with a bug.
* If a player loses all 4 lives then they lose.
* if a player reaches a score of 5000 (and reaches water!) then they will win.
* Gems will randomly appear at the start of the game to boost a player's score.
* Only an Easy difficulty is accessible the first time a user plays.
* Use Arrow keys on a keyboard to move or, if on mobile or tablet, use the touch buttons that will appear.
